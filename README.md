# Display-Switcher
Upgraded display switcher based on  monitor swapper automation and MultiMonitorTool
original script here:https://github.com/Nonary/MonitorSwapAutomation
How it works
This script uses multimonitor tool to activate the dummy screen and make it the primary while sunshine is connected, this makes possible the use of the computer while sunshine is used and once sunshine is closed it deletes the dummy screen
